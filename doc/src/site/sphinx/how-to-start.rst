Where to go from here?
======================

To explore and play with Stratio Ingestion, we recommend to visit the following:

-   Download the code from the Stratio Ingestion repository: https://github.com/Stratio/Ingestion/

-   :ref:`wikipedia-pagecounts-demo`: Execute one of the existing demos to understand better how to use Ingestion agent

-   :ref:`configuration`: Check some configuration details to understand how to setup your first Ingestion agent

-   Configure your first example agent to get data from any source, transform the data and send to your datastore. Also you can take a look at :ref:`apache-logs-demo` as reference. It could be a good starting point to setup your custom agent
