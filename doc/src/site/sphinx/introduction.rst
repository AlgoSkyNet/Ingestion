What is Apache Flume?
=====================

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store.

Its use is not only designed for logs, in fact you can find a myriad of sources, sinks and transformations.

In addition, a sink could be a big data storage but also another real-time system (Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming).


What is Stratio Ingestion?
==========================

-  Data stream solution to operate over large data streams

-  Collection of heterogeneous information from a variety of systems

   -  The centralized ingestion of data generated by applications, servers and technical infrastructure, allows the
      optimization of the data lifecycle, and the application of intelligence over the whole ensemble of information

-  Extract value from information

   -  In a typical organization there are hundreds of data formats. Getting rid of information structure differences
      and isolating the data from the technical singularities of its source, are critical issues for the platform business targets.

-  Information exploitation

   -  Accomplishment of administrative objectives typically only requires basic information storage. However,
      developing business intelligence over a constantly changing structure, requires a solution that guarantees the viability of data over time.
